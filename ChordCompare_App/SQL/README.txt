The !Setup.sql file will setup the database

The tables and functions are created in schema called final_project.

A user named final_app is also created. The web server connects using this user.

Postgres will not see the schema by default. You can run the SetSessionSchema.sql file to add it to your psql search path.

Not all the tables are currently in play. Some are just sketches of ideas.
